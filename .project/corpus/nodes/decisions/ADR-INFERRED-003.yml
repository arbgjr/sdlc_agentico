rationale: 'Jwt was detected as the authentication solution based on evidence found
  in 4 file(s): .claude/skills/sdlc-import/scripts/confidence_scorer.py, .claude/skills/sdlc-import/tests/unit/test_confidence_scorer.py,
  .claude/skills/sdlc-import/tests/unit/test_threat_modeler.py, and 1 more. The codebase
  shows 4 reference(s) to jwt indicating it is the adopted technology for this concern.'
