    DevOps Research and Assessment (DORA) metrics are four key performance
    indicators used to measure software delivery performance and operational
    efficiency.

    ## The Four DORA Metrics

    1. **Deployment Frequency**
       - Definition: How often an organization successfully deploys to production
       - Elite: Multiple per day
       - Low: Less than once per month

    2. **Lead Time for Changes**
       - Definition: Time from commit to running in production
       - Elite: Less than 1 hour
       - Low: More than 6 months

    3. **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)**
       - Definition: How long to recover from production failure
       - Elite: Less than 1 hour
       - Low: More than 1 week

    4. **Change Failure Rate**
       - Definition: Percentage of deployments causing failure
       - Elite: 0-15%
       - Low: 46-60%

    ## Calculation from GitHub

    - Deployment Frequency: Count successful workflow runs
    - Lead Time: PR merge time + deployment time
    - MTTR: Requires external incident tracking
    - Change Failure Rate: Requires failure classification
